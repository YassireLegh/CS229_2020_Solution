This is my own solution for Stanford's CS229 problem sets.
These problem sets are designed for the summer edition (2019, 2020) of the course. 
My solutions can be found in the psets folder (both source code for coding questions and pdf's for writing questions). 
You can find materials of this course (lecture notes, raw unsolved psets) in the archive folder. 
Lecture videos are available on YouTube.
